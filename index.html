            To become a Web Developer, should have an understanding of HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. It’s also recommended to learn about CSS and
            CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills
            will give the foundation and logic for communicating with
            programming languages. It’s important to note that Web Developers –
            more than most other fields – must be committed to ongoing learning
            to stay on top of changes in web development and programming
            languages, tools, and trends. This makes mid-career retraining a
            must whether or not it’s the line of work you started out in.

            It’s true – when you lend someone a helping hand, you feel a lot
            better about yourself, and you will likely learn something new.
            Helping others feels so rewarding because you know that you have
            contributed something very important to humanity. And what better
            way to help your fellow developers than to join one of the many
